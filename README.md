## About
Link Shortener is a open source Discord Bot which uses various api's to shorten links. Current supported shorteners include [is.gd](https://is.gd) and [v.gd](https://v.gd). There are plans to add more in the future. You can invite the bot [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=755474829364428840&permissions=84032&scope=bot)
## Self Hosting
If you wish to self host you will need to make some small edits to the code before starting the bot. This guide will assume you already have a Discord Developer Application, that node.js is installed, and that you know how to install dependencies. You can use Google to find out how to do these things if you don't know how.
1. Make a .env file in the same directory your bot will be running in and put **BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token**. Replacing "your-bot-token" with your bot's token. 
2. Decide if your bot will need to be pinged by an external service to stay online. This will often be the case when hosting with services like [repl.it](https://repl.it) or something similar. If pinging is not required you must comment out some code. You must go in index.js and find where the pinging code is which will be marked by a comment. If you require pinging you can leave the code as it. You may need to change firewall/network settings depending on your configuration. The pinging server defaults to port 3000 but can be changed on the strings.json file.
3. Now you must install the required dependencies for the bot to function properly.  These include [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js), [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios), and [systeminformation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/systeminformation). If you are going to use the pinging code you must also install [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express).
4. Now you can edit configuration settings in strings.json include the main embed color, error embed color, and some error messages.
5. Now assuming you followed this guide correctly (or I didn't mess up writing it) your bot should now be ready to start. You can use `node index.js` to start the bot up. If the bot is running correctly your console should look like this:
`Logged in as [your-bots-name-and-tag]!`
`Status set`
If you are using the pinging code your console will also include:
`Express running` at the top.

If you find these instructions too complicated you can also run this on [repl.it](https://repl.it) using this button:
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/TheLimifiedLime/Link-Shortener-Bot)](https://repl.it/github/TheLimifiedLime/Link-Shortener-Bot)
You will still need to do instructions 1, 2, and 4. Dependencies are automatically installed and you start the bot by using the run button at the top of the UI. This method will need the website generated by the site (towards the top right) to be pinged every so often (5 minutes works great in my testing). You can use a site like [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com) and their free plan to set up a http monitor to ping your generated URL. If you need help feel free to open an issue in this repository but I might not respond for a few hours, days or maybe longer.
